# HTTP_Server

A small HTTP server that provides basic user authentication and supports
returning contents of files. Users can log in with a username and password, and upon
successful authentication, they can query the contents of files from the users directory. The
server is designed to use cookies to manage user sessions and to ensure the security of file
retrieval.
